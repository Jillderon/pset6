# Happy Home App 
With Happy Home App you and your roommates can add weekly chores to a list of chores that have to be done. When you or your roommate(s) did a chore they can click on it and it will be checked off. Every monday all the chores will be updated and they need to be checked off for the new week. Because a clean house isn't the world, this app also provides some fun! Every week (on monday), a new online book will be available for you and your roommates to read. 

The app uses GoogleBooks API. Small user data (filled in email) is presisted on the app, due to using UserDefaults and state restauration.
